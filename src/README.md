#### This is fast rounding

    a.	(*) 			 arithmetic operation to apply
    b.	(RoundToZero)	 directed rounding mode to use
    c.	(1.7635, 1.3570) values to which the operation shall apply 
    
```julia
    p = 1.7635_0f0;
    r = 1.3570_0f0;

    result  = (*)(p, r, RoundToZero) 
    2.3930693_0f0

    result  = (*)(p, r, RoundFromZero)     # RoundFromZero with Float32, Float64
    2.3930695_0f0                          # ( for the scrapbook, a Julia first )
    
```

##### This is round fast
Some applications require Frequent Resetting of and Cascaded Changes to the floating point rounding mode.  
Most users are very motivated to avoid this temporal drain.  Some users will find RoundFast is in use.

The Rounding Mode is not changed and the rounding directed arithmetic continues to give correct results.
````latex
Directed Rounding is performed with accurate knowledge of the insignificant
part of the result under RoundNearest.  With the result of calculating under
RoundNearest given, *and knowing that* the insignificant part, too small to
store with the value of the result, if it is positive [or if negative]:
the calculation RoundingDown must have the result:
 
             prevfloat( the result found in RoundNearest )   
             [or if negative, the result in RoundNearest ]
 
```
Error free transformation of an arithmetic operation delivers the significant result with
some of any numerical residuate -- so the sign of any numerical remainder becomes known.
With that, the correct action to match the arithmetic calculation with directed rounding 
is determined.  RoundFast does RoundFast.
