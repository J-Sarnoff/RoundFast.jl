# RoundFast.jl
Fast directed rounding for inline arithmetic.




#### using RoundFast

Choose the rounding mode to use.  It must be one of these modes.   
{RoundNearest, RoundUp, RoundDown, RoundToZero, RoundFromZero}.   

Apply the arithmetic operator, specifying args and then rounding mode.

```julia

  z  = (*)(gof, gop, RoundFromZero)   # use RoundFromZero with system Floats. 
  
  lo = (-)(a.lo, b.hi, RoundDown)     # interval subtraction, accurately rounded
  hi = (-)(a.hi, b.lo, RoundUp)       # processor settings do not change

```
